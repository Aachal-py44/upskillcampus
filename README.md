In this internship, I worked on forecasting traffic patterns in smart cities, leveraging advanced technologies like Machine Learning and IoT.
The project involved analyzing data from various sensors and historical traffic records to develop predictive models.
These models aim to optimize urban traffic management and enhance transportation systems.
This internship provided an excellent opportunity to address real-world challenges related to smart city infrastructure and improve traffic flow, contributing to better city planning and resource management.
